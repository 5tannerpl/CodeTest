Fork this repository. There are 2 projects in the solution - a WebAPI and a React application.

The WebAPI has been deployed to https://codetestwebapp20240407064956.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html. **There is no work you need to do in the WebAPI**

Run the React application and the instructions for the code test will appear. The code test includes using KendoUI. A trial version has been installed. **You do not need to fix the watermark that Kendo adds.**
